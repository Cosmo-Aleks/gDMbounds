Project Restructuring Summary
1. Project Structure
We discussed the importance of organizing your project into multiple files 
for better maintainability and readability. The proposed structure is as follows:
/your_project
│
├── dmbounds/
│ ├── init.py # Makes this directory a package
│ ├── data_reader.py # Functions to read .ecsv files
│ ├── plotter.py # Functions for plotting
│ ├── computations.py # Functions for computations
│ └── dmbounds.py # Main file that uses the above modules
│
└── main.py # Entry point for your application

2. Renaming dmbounds.py
You decided to rename dmbounds.py to dmbounds_old.py to keep the old 
version and create a new dmbounds.py.

3. Extracting Functions

3.1 Data Reader Functions
We extracted functions related to reading .ecsv files from dmbounds_old.py 
and organized them into data_reader.py.

3.2 Plotting Functions
We extracted plotting-related functions from dmbounds_old.py and organized 
them into plotter.py.

3.3 Example Functions
data_reader.py:
read_ecsv(file_path)
read_multiple_ecsv(instrument_dict)
table_to_dict(table, keycolumn_name, valuecolumn_name)
plotter.py:
plot_data(x, y, label)
save_plot(filename)
set_plot_style(style='seaborn')
clear_plot()
Additional functions for multiple datasets, histograms, and scatter plots 
were suggested.

4. Setting Up dmbounds.py
We structured dmbounds.py to import the necessary functions and orchestrate 
the workflow:
Import necessary modules.
Define a base directory to manage file paths.
Create a main function to read data, process it, and plot results.

5. Using a Base Directory
We discussed how to define a base directory in dmbounds.py to manage file 
paths relative to the script's location.

6. Modifying dictionaries.py
You asked about modifying dictionaries.py to incorporate channel definitions 
from legend_channels.py. We discussed how to import channel definitions and 
update or create dictionaries accordingly.
